<h4 id="what-is-ai">What is AI?</h4>
<p>Simply put, AI is the creation of software that imitates human behaviors and capabilities. Key elements include:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Machine learning</strong>  - This is often the foundation for an AI system, and is the way we “teach” a computer model to make prediction and draw conclusions from data.</li>
<li><strong>Anomaly detection</strong>  - The capability to automatically detect errors or unusual activity in a system.</li>
<li><strong>Computer vision</strong>  - The capability of software to interpret the world visually through cameras, video, and images.</li>
<li><strong>Natural language processing</strong>  - The capability for a computer to interpret written or spoken language, and respond in kind.</li>
<li><strong>Conversational AI</strong>  - The capability of a software “agent” to participate in a conversation.</li>
</ul>

<p>Machine Learning is the foundation for most AI solutions.</p>
<p>Machines learn from data. Data scientists can use all of that data to train machine learning models that can make predictions and inferences based on the relationships they find in the data.</p>
